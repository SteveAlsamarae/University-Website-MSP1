          <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs for 2021</h2>
          <p>
            A modern language degree is not just about learning a new language –
            though of course attaining a high level of fluency is one of the
            goals. Many programs will require students to study courses which
            develop their understanding of past and present cultures relating to
            the country (or countries) in which the language of study is spoken.
            This learning often requires the study of literary texts, film and
            media, as well as learning about the historical and political
            contexts of a certain region. Professionally focused courses may
            also be available, covering topics such as translation,
            international relations, business processes in different regions, or
            media and communication studies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It’s possible to study modern languages either as a single honors
            degree or alongside another subject as a joint honors degree. Common
            joint honors choices often remain within the humanities, including
            subjects such as politics, history and literature, but modern
            languages can also be combined with subjects such as chemistry or
            mathematics, for those wishing to keep their options as broad as
            possible. Another option is to study two languages, such as Arabic
            and And Spanish.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One of the main attractions of a modern language degree is the
            opportunity to spend either a semester or a year abroad in a country
            where the language of study is widely spoken. This experience aims
            to increase proficiency in the language of study, while also
            allowing students to immerse themselves in another culture and meet
            the challenge of communicating with a broad range of people. For
            this reason, many modern language programs are four years in length,
            with one year (often the third year) spent in a partnered
            institution abroad, either working or studying.
